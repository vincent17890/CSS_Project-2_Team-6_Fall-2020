In this project, we develop and test various machine learning models to predict diabetes rates in United States counties. Please see project2_udpated.ipynb for the most up-to-date Jupyter Notebook, which contains our final analysis. The original dataset used in the analysis can be found in "Diabetes with Population Info by County 2017.csv." 

Please direct any questions regarding this project to Vincent Chen (vincentpmchen@berkeley.edu), Lawrence Liu (ljliu@berkeley.edu), and Kelly Quinn (kellyquinn@berkeley.edu).
